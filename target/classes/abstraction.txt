Contains data about abstraction.
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.
It can also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details

Why do we use interface ?

- It is used to achieve total abstraction.
- Since java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using interface it can achieve multiple inheritance .
- It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
- Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. Even we have abstract classes still we use interface to achieve data abstraction because abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are final, public and static.

To implement an interface we use keyword: implements

Few keypoints about abstract classes:
- In Java, an instance of an abstract class cannot be created, we can have references of abstract class type though
- An abstract class can contain constructors in Java. And a constructor of abstract class is called when an instance of a inherited class is created.
-  In Java, we can have an abstract class without any abstract method. This allows us to create classes that cannot be instantiated, but can only be inherited.
- Abstract classes can also have final methods (methods that cannot be overridden). 
- For any abstract java class we are not allowed to create an object i.e., for abstract class instantiation is not possible.
